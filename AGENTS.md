# Repository Agents and Components

This document describes the agents, tools, and components within this repository. It provides the necessary context for autonomous agents like **AlphaEvolve** to operate effectively.

## Core Environment Agents

* **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (The Architect)**
    * **Function:** This file is the master blueprint for the entire development environment. It defines the base operating system, required extensions, and the commands needed to construct the container.
    * **Interaction:** It is the entry point for GitHub Codespaces. It orchestrates the entire setup by executing the Engineer.

* **`.devcontainer/install-mizar.sh` (The Engineer)**
    * **Function:** This script is the hands-on builder. It executes the Architect's plan, performing the step-by-step installation and configuration of the Mizar system inside the container.
    * **Interaction:** It is called by the `postCreateCommand` in the `devcontainer.json` file. It runs non-interactively and must succeed for the environment to be created.

## User-Facing Application Agents

* **`src/server.py` (The Web Server)**
    * **Function:** This agent is a Flask-based web server that provides a user-friendly graphical interface for the Mizar verifier. It accepts Mizar code from a web page and returns the verifier's output.
    * **Input:** Receives a JSON object with a `code` key via a `POST` request to the `/verify` endpoint.
    * **Output:** Returns a JSON object with a `result` key containing the text output from the Mizar verifier.

* **`src/main.py` (The Server Starter)**
    * **Function:** A simple wrapper script whose sole purpose is to launch the Web Server.
    * **Interaction:** Can be called directly (`python src/main.py`) or via the `start_server` scripts.

## Command-Line Helper Agents

* **`verify.py` (The Command-Line Verifier)**
    * **Function:** This script provides direct, command-line access to the Mizar verifier.
    * **Interaction:** It is designed to be called by the `.bat` and `.ps1` wrapper scripts.
    * **Input:** Expects a single command-line argument: the path to the `.miz` file to be verified (e.g., `python verify.py my_proof.miz`).
    * **Output:** Prints the raw text output from the Mizar verifier directly to the console.

* **Wrapper Scripts (`.bat` and `.ps1`)**
    * **Function:** These are simple, convenient wrappers that allow users to invoke the Python agents with a native feel for their operating system (Batch for Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell for modern Windows terminals).
    * **Interaction:** They pass their command-line arguments directly to the underlying Python scripts.
